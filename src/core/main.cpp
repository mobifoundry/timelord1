// Application: TimeLord1
// Company: Positively Front Street, Inc
// DBA: mobiFoundry
// Author: Louis Meadows
// Target: Nokia WRT 1.0/1.1 E51/E71/E71x mobile phone
// Default now AT&T E71x, for E51 user will need to set cursor mode in options.
// Date: Oct 2nd 2009
// Description: Job Management - Time and materials application
//
// TimeLord1 is a Job based tracking of Labor, Materials and Tasks (to-do list).
// It allows a Contractor to clock in/out personnel, track materials use and
// task completion.  Supports up to 10 job locations with employees/subcontractors,
// materials and tasks at each. Advanced version supports bluetooth/location based
// clock in/out of employees/subcontractors when all jobs must run concurrently
// and on schedule.  Labor and Materials tracking in real time provides for maximizing
// profit by reducing these key costs. Tracking and assigning of Job tasks allows for
// better completion estimates for builders and project planners alike. Timelord1 was
// designed to run on the Nokia E51/71 business phone.
//
// 04Nov09 RNM added Spanish text variables - all ending in "es" the international 2
//         character code for SPAIN (Espana)
//		   Although you sent me an example with "es" on the end of the variable name,
//		   I felt it better to capitalize this, especially thinking ahead to the 20
//		   different language versions we intend to support.  So "es" became "ES"  OK?
