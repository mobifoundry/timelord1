// Description: Job Management - Time and materials application
//
// TimeLord1 is a Job based tracking of Labor, Materials and Tasks (to-do list).
// It allows a Contractor to clock in/out personnel, track materials use and 
// task completion.  Supports up to 10 job locations with employees/subcontractors,
// materials and tasks at each. Advanced version supports bluetooth/location based
// clock in/out of employees/subcontractors when all jobs must run concurrently 
// and on schedule.  Labor and Materials tracking in real time provides for maximizing
// profit by reducing these key costs. Tracking and assigning of Job tasks allows for 
// better completion estimates for builders and project planners alike. Timelord1 was
// designed to run on the Nokia E51/71 business phone.
